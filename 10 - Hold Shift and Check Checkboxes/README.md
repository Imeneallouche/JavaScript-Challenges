<h1 align='center'>✨ Shift Checkboxes Technique ✨</h1>
<hr><br>

<p align='center'> 
  this is a box checker that is also powered with a new feature: <b> shift hold checker </b>
</p>

<p align='center'> 
  in addition of checking the checkboxes one by one -by clicking on them-  you can check a bunch of checkboxes at the same time by: 
</p>




<b>
<table width='100%' align='center'>
  <tr>
    <td colspan='10'>1- selecting the first checkbox</td>
  </tr>
  
  
   <tr>
    <td colspan='10'>2- holding the shift key</td>
  </tr>
  
  
   <tr>
    <td colspan='10'>3- selecting another checkbox</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</b>


<p align='center'> 
  you will notice that all the ckeckboxes that are between the two checkboxes you selected are all checked and this is thanks to the shilft hold technique
  that makes it easy and fast for you
</p>
